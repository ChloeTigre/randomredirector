# how to use

edit the html file and change the URLs

# why?

purely client side, no caching of the redirection as would happen with 30X
on most browsers,

I use `<link rel="next">` elements because, heh, at least it's semantic.

The docker thingie is just for show-off, and because I use it in a Docker
infrastructure for my as-of-this-commit employer, [Bluenove](https://www.bluenove.com).


Cheers :-)
